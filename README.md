# #2 The Odin Project - Foundations Project: Odin Landing Page

In this project we are making a landing page from scratch. Trying to make it as similar to the reference as possible (HTML and CSS only). Reference can be found in img folder.

This was fun project to build. Some of the required designs were not achievable by default, so a little bit of research came in hand.
